# A general introduction about me

My name is, well, Amaan and I am a self taught computer programmer. I just generally like to code
including during my freetime. My pronouns are he/him and I am mostly experienced with Python. I
know a couple more languages which include

- Python3
- HTML5
- CSS
- Nim
- C (Basics)
- Rust (Basics)
- SQL (Basics)
- Kotlin (Basics)

I will say it already, I do not like Rust and would probabbly prefer not to work with it ever again.
That is due to its torturingly bad Memory System that I hate so much that I would rather use PHP.

### A few behavioral patterns about me
 
- I tend to use emojis very scarcely, so you might get my meaning of sentences wrong sometimee
- I prefer not to be mentioned for something I am totally unrelated with. For example, if someone
  just created a new repo, I wouldn't attend to any requests for my help. When people do this, it
  makes me sad.
- I am going to mention it once and for all, I am a student and I am not for hire.

### What I want to learn in the near future

There are many things that I am trying to learn or want to learn, here is a short list of them:

- C++ and C
- Basic Operating System Development
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Android Development with Jetpack and Kotlin
- JavaScript for frontend and backend
