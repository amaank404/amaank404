My name is, well, Amaan and I am a self taught soft dev. I code 
during my freetime. Refer me as he/him and my playing field is mostly Python. I
know a couple more interesting stuff n languages :D

- Python3
- HTML5
- CSS
- C (Basics)
- Rust (Basics)
- SQL (Basics)

My use of emoticons may be scarce :P so lemme know if I say something mean.

As for libraries and frameworks, I can't be bothered to list them since I am almost never stuck on a single one of em (Just too much interesting stuff on the internet :P). My fields of knowledge is mostly backend with a pinch of networking.

### Here is pretty much all I wanna do next

Learning is a long process ngl, hence I ain't committed to this stuff yet but would love to learn it all :D

- C++ and C  (I hope I pick this up from college)
- Mobile dev with flutter (I sure like flutter but this one is gonna take time n practice :/ )
- JavaScript for frontend and backend (pretty popular last I heard)
- Rust (n some Vulkan along with it)

### Mean Side (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

* Dontcha mention me on something unrelated
* I ain't for hire and nor am I gonna help out of my own free will :P
* Respect my privacy ಠ_ಠ

### 日本語を勉強してる

日本が好きなので、日本語を勉強してる。まだ日本語があんまり話せない。漫画やアニメが大好き。
